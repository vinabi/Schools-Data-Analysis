## üìä Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of school information, infrastructure details, and resource availability. Due to GitHub's file size limitation, the dataset is split into two parts:

- `Schools_Dataset 0.0`
- `Schools_Dataset 0.1`

## üìà Project Overview

This project examines schools across Punjab to guide an international ed-tech company investing in local educational infrastructure. Through analysis, we identify regions needing improvement and offer insights into resource allocation, enrollment trends, and school facilities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies and Tools Used

- **Microsoft Excel** for data cleaning, manipulation, and preliminary analysis
